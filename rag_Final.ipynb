The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants).  4  |  Introduction'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Macronutrients  Nutrients  that  are  needed  in  large  amounts  are  called  macronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.  Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can  be unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks  Introduction  |  5'}]"

However, many older adults remain in relatively  good health and continue to be active into their golden years. Good  nutrition is often the key to maintaining health later in life. In  addition, the fitness and nutritional choices made earlier in life set  the stage for continued health and happiness.\\xa0 Older adults should  continue to consume nutrient-dense foods and remain physically  active. However, deficiencies are more common after age sixty,  primarily due to reduced intake or malabsorption. The loss of  mobility among frail, homebound elderly adults also impacts their  access to healthy, diverse foods.  Energy and Macronutrients  Due to reductions in lean body mass and metabolic rate, older  adults require less energy than younger adults. The energy  requirements for people ages fifty-one and over are 1,600 to 2,200  calories for women and 2,000 to 2,800 calories for men, depending  on activity level. The decrease in physical activity that is typical of  older adults also influences nutritional requirements. The AMDRs  for carbohydrates, protein, and fat remain the same from middle  age into old age. Older adults should substitute more unrefined  carbohydrates for refined ones, such as whole grains and brown  rice. Fiber is especially important in preventing constipation and  diverticulitis, and may also reduce the risk of colon cancer. Protein  3.\\xa0McMillan, B. (2008).

Each paddler will say they  have their own “secret” training nutrition plan which may consist of  a specific food or drink they prefer, but the bottom line is that the  energy from carbohydrates, protein, and fat they ingest is required  to fuel their body for training, recovering and repairing so they are  able to continue to perform at high levels. Having a nutrition plan  for race day is equally important for achieving peak performance  and there are all sorts of products available with claims about  digestibility,  energy-sustenance,  and  promises  of  optimal  performance results. Even with all of these highly specified and  formulated products many paddlers prefer to rely on what fueled  Native Hawaiians and other ancient voyager, poi.

An  occasional amino acid drink in the place of a meal is not a  problem. However, problems may arise if you add the  supplement to your existing diet. Most Americans receive two  to three times the amount of protein required on a daily basis  from their existing diets—taking amino acid supplements just  adds to the excess. Also, certain amino acids share the same  transport systems in the absorption process; therefore, a  concentrated excess of one amino acid obtained from a  supplement may increase the probability of decreased  absorption of another amino acid that uses the same transport  system. This could lead to deficiency in the competing amino  acid.  Supplement Claims and Restrictions  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements,  but it treats them like food rather than pharmaceuticals. Dietary  supplements must meet the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Standards,  but are not required to meet the standards for drugs, although  some companies do so voluntarily. Also, although supplement  manufacturers are allowed to say a particular ingredient may reduce  the risk of a disease or disorder, or that it might specifically target  certain body systems, these claims are not approved by the FDA.  This is why labels that make structural and functional claims are  required to carry a disclaimer saying the product is not intended  “to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” In addition, in the  United States, supplements are taken off the market only after the  Food Supplements and Food Replacements  |  979',\n",

For each item in pages_and_texts, it loops through the \"sentence_chunks\" field, joining each chunk's sentences into a single string (a paragraph-like structure). The string is cleaned, ensuring proper spacing and formatting, including a regular expression to fix punctuation spacing (e.g., \".A\" becomes \". A\"). Each chunk's metadata is calculated, including character count (chunk_char_count), word count (chunk_word_count), and approximate token count (chunk_token_count, based on the assumption that 1 token equals ~4 characters). Finally, the processed chunk is appended to the pages_and_chunks list. At the end, len(pages_and_chunks) provides the total number of sentence chunks created."

    "The code uses the SentenceTransformers library to generate sentence embeddings, which are numerical representations of textual data. It initializes a SentenceTransformer model with the pre-trained all-mpnet-base-v2 model, configured to run on the CPU. A list of sentences is defined, and the model.encode() method is used to encode these sentences into embeddings. The sentences and their corresponding embeddings are then stored in a dictionary, where the sentences serve as keys and the embeddings as values. Finally, the code iterates through the dictionary to print each sentence alongside its embedding. This enables the embeddings to be used for tasks such as semantic similarity, clustering, or other natural language processing applications."

An in-memory instance, created by passing \":memory:\" as the path argument (e.g., QdrantClient(\":memory:\")), operates entirely in the system's RAM. This configuration is ideal for quick experiments, prototyping, or testing, as it provides faster operations due to the absence of disk I/O. However, because it operates in memory, all stored data will be lost when the program terminates. On the other hand, an on-disk instance is created by providing a valid file path to the path argument (e.g., QdrantClient(path=\"qdrant_storage\")). This configuration persists data to disk, allowing the embeddings, collections, and metadata to remain intact across program runs. It is best suited for production scenarios or situations where the stored vectors need to be retained for long-term use. Additionally, for distributed systems or large-scale applications, a server-based instance can be used by connecting to a running Qdrant server via its URL (e.g., QdrantClient(url=\"http://localhost:6333\")). This enables centralized storage and management of vector embeddings and allows multiple clients or applications to query and update the same collection. Each method provides flexibility, with in-memory instances optimized for speed and temporary usage, on-disk instances for persistence in standalone applications, and server-based instances for scalability and distributed access."
